                            I started as a Software Developer for the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. For the bank I developed a reporting system for forecasting banking sector liquidity, providing distributed 100-user access to reports. I also designed a system for checking reports of the banks' activities and Integrated the gathering report system with UN/EDIFACT bank’s transfer system. All of this allows unifying the requirements for banks’ reports and increased the stability of the system from 80% to 99.8%.

                            After 1.5 years I was promoted to an Oracle Database Developer position. In this role, I designed and built from scratch integration between separate IT corporate systems, created a replication monitoring system, and fully reorganized the database structure for our clients.

                            At this time I met with Python. So, in 2 years, I was shifted to a Python Developer position at the same company. I was involved in several projects connected with the modernization and upgrade of the system. One of the main I am very proud of was upgrading legacy clearing algorithms in Delphi. I modified about 30 clearing algorithms, upgraded them with new features, and deployed them to anew Python system. That helped to increase the speed of processing and financial reports’ accuracy and we get rid of the immense cost of legacy project support.<br>
                            Another project was to develop a new way of exchanging data between internal corporate systems instead of “human emailing”. It increased the processing speed for incoming requests by 40%.

                            At the end of 2021, I was involved in a project for creating an online store for the Netology company. It was an “evening- and weekend-time” job. I developed models and API endpoints from scratch, an admin dashboard, and full-test coverage of API endpoints for the online store. I also optimized SQL queries and database structures for better performance.
